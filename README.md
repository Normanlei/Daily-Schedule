# Daily-Schedule

## Description

As proceeing as a web developer, I am realizing timing is critical and significant for me since I am getting busier and busier. An simple daily scheduler would help me effectively manage my hourly time. I am to build a simple calendar application to keep track of each hour of business hour of day.

Currently, the calendar I built has a few features as below:
* Header Section with live time counting

* Calender Section with save button and dynamically enter event at hourly time block

In the process of building this calendar, I have learned:
* Utilize Github repository, familiarize git commands to save all my works onto github
* Familiarize the basic html commands to build the full contents of the site, especially have better understanding on div.
* Familiarize the styling commands on css, especially have better understanding on float, padding, margin, position
* Familiarize the bootstrap tags and utilize the documentations resourses on bootstrap website
* Realize using Bootstrap tags to build the main structure of the site is much more consice and easier
* Familiarize using jQuery to add more functional features along with html and css styling
* Using jQuery to add content to html more efficiently
* Using icon from FontAwesome site
* Familiarize using localStorage to persist data
